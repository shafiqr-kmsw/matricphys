<h2>Experiment: Two Identical Resistors in Series</h2>

<p>
In this virtual experiment, you will investigate the relationship between current and voltage
for two identical resistors connected in series.
</p>

<p>
When the <b>Generate</b> button is pressed:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A theoretical resistance value (between 3 Ω and 9 Ω) for a single resistor is randomly generated.</li>
  <li>An actual resistance value is internally produced with a deviation of less than 10% from the theoretical value.</li>
  <li>Using this actual resistance, voltage–current data for two resistors in series is generated.</li>
  <li>A best-fit straight line is calculated from the data to determine the effective resistance.</li>
  <li>The uncertainty in the gradient and the percentage error relative to the theoretical value are computed.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Assume Ohm’s Law applies and that measurement uncertainty arises from experimental variation only.
